In my 23.5 years of living, I can finally say I felt I had a truly successful and remarkable year. In this letter, I want to reminisce upon the good memories I made, the goals I achieved, my favorite creative works of the year, and what I look forward to and plan to achieve next year. 

In 2024, I set 4 goals:
1. Read 20 books - I finished reading 20 books on January 2nd, 2026 so I consider this a success
2. Get an internship - Achieved
3. Publish Research - Submitted our paper to MobiSys 2026
4. Get a research position or a job at a startup - Achieved both

### Winter
I started off the year taking 3 classes at UCLA: Convex Optimization, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. I dropped convex optimization to focus on more machine learning-related classes, a decision I somewhat regret. At the end of 2024, I thought I wanted to focus on becoming a ML engineer. It's an extremely hot field and I figured it would give me more freedom with my job opportunities. I thought I was tired of Wireless Communications and figured it just wasn't for me anymore. 

Few weeks into Deep Learning and Neural Networks, I was sitting in the lecture hall and couldn't convince myself that I belonged there or that I was enjoying myself by any means. I had realized I would never be truly passionate about ML. My professor spoke with enthusiasm and optimism; students would ask engaging questions and always be interested in what comes next. I couldn't force myself to have any of those feelings. It was that week that I realized how much I had loved Wireless Comms, how much I missed the complex calculus and statistics, and how much passion I felt in developing systems to help people communicate. 

During the next few weeks, I decided I needed to join a research lab to pursue my interests properly. The only lab that truly fit my interests was the Wireless lab under Professor Ian Roberts. He was young, ambitious, and was researching hot topics that are slowly emerging commercially. We met quickly after I sent a long email detailing my interests and we decided to explore the research opportunities with some commercial, 60Ghz Wi-Fi routers.
