For this month's essay, I want to write a short piece detailing my goals for the year. I ended 2025 achieving all my goals for the year. I read 20 books, got an internship, became a graduate researcher, and joined a wireless communications startup. It was, by far, the most successful year of my life and I want to continue riding that momentum and setting myself up for the next stage of my life: being a mid-twenties full-time engineer. 

I want to set a few concrete goals to try to achieve this year. The first of which being: reading 25 books. In 2025, I was fairly consistent at reading most weeks, but that consistency took a dip when I would read a boring book or get lazy before bed and watch Netflix. I want to try to push myself to become more consistent by reading every single day and forcing myself out of bad sleeping habits. The second goal I have is to run twice a week. Unfortunately, this is a goal I have already failed at :/. However, I will keep pushing myself to do 2 runs per week and get into the general habit of doing some form of regular cardiovascular exercise. 

The third goal I have is brand new to my life - I want to write an essay every month and post it on my website. Throughout my life, I was not a good writer by any means. However, as I get older, I start to understand and appreciate the beauty and importance of being a good writer. The idea for this came from watching *Dead Poets Society*. The movie beautifully portrayed the importance of writing about your emotions, thoughts, and ideas even if you are an engineer, businessman, or whatever.
