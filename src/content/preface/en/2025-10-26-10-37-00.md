### Hi, I'm Kanishka. 
I'm currently a masters student studying electrical engineering at UCLA. I'm a researcher at the [Wireless Lab @ UCLA](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/) under Prof. Ian Roberts. I'm currently exploring research topics relating to mmWave wireless communications, machine learning, system design, and sensing. I also work as a RF System Design Intern for a Wireless Communications Startup, [SkyGig](https://sky-gig.com/) where we are building 5G Telecom Technology. 

My hobbies rotate between video games, guitar, reading, and enjoying movies. I also really love to eat and try new foods. 

This website serves as my creative outlet for writing, reviewing things, and just generally documenting my life so when I'm old, I can remenisce upon different periods of my life. Here's some places you may want to visit:
 - [Book Reviews](tbd): Quick reviews of books I read, I try to read 20 a year
 - [Movie Reviews](tbd): Some reviews are short, some are long depending on how I felt
