I'm currently a masters student studying electrical engineering at UCLA. I'm a researcher at the [Wireless Lab @ UCLA](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/) under Prof. Ian Roberts. I'm currently exploring research topics relating to mmWave wireless communications, machine learning, system design, and sensing. I also work as a RF System Design Intern for a Wireless Communications Startup, [SkyGig](https://sky-gig.com/) where we are building 5G Telecom Technology. I did my undergrad in electrical engineering from University of California, San Diego. At UCSD, I was an undergrad researcher at the [WCSNG Lab](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/) under Prof. Dinesh Bharadia and I was president of our IEEE-HKN Chapter. 

My hobbies rotate between video games, guitar, reading, and enjoying movies. I also really love to eat and try new foods. 

This website serves as my creative outlet for writing, reviewing things, and just generally documenting my life so when I'm old, I can remenisce upon different periods of my life. It also serves as my online reference to a lot of useful notes regarding wireless communications, digital signal processing, ML, and buidling good software. 

If you're interested in my reviews, here's some places you may want to visit:
